# petra_grid

**`petra_grid` is a library for reading grid data in the `.GRD` file
format produced by the Petraâ„¢ geological interpretation application**

---

This library is based on a lot of time spent in a hex editor looking at
grid files and poring over publicly-available documentation. It is by necessity
incomplete and incorrect, and will remain so until the file format is properly
and publicly specified.

However, the library is able to successfully read rectangular and triangulated
grids and a good portion of their metadata. Please open an issue if you have
trouble reading a grid and are able to share the grid (in GRD and exported form)
with the developer.

A nice example should go here.
